<h2>PBE</h2>
<p>
The PBE Application is an extensible workflow application to perform Performance Based Engineering computations for various hazards. The current release provides researchers a tool to assess the performance of a building in an earthquake scenario. The application focuses on quantifying building performance through decision variables.
It builds on the EE-UQ App and uses its response estimates to assess the damage to building components and the consequences of such damage.
