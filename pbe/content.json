It integrates EE-UQ modules for open-source seismic response simulations and supports commercial tools and non-seismic hazards by importing external response data. Various uncertainties in damage and loss models can be represented and propagated through the analyses. Custom user-defined models and calculation methodologies are also supported. The PBE Application simulates the repair process of a building from damage and loss results through an integrated functional recovery tool. Outputs are provided in a standardized format for further analysis.",
