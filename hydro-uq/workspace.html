<h2>HYDRO-UQ</h2>
<p>
The Hydro-UQ Application is open-source software that provides researchers a tool to assess the performance of a building subjected to loading due to tsunami and storm surge. The tool allows 2-D shallow water solutions obtained from far-from-coast calculations as input to a 3-D CFD solver. This facilitates a multiscale coupling by resolving areas of interest by coupling shallow-water solvers with CFD solvers. <br><br>
