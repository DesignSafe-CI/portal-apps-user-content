<h2>EE-UQ</h2>
<p>
The EE-UQ Tool is an application to determine the response, including UQ, of a structure to an earthquake excitation. The tool focuses on the structural model and will evolve to include soil-structure interaction models imposing boundary conditions necessary to impart the earthquake motion. The application is focused on quantifying the uncertainties in the predicted response, given that the properties of the buildings and the earthquake events are not known exactly, and that the simulation software and the user make simplifying assumptions in the numerical modeling of that structure.
