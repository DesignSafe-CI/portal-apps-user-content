<h2>WE-UQ</h2>
<p>
The WE-UQ Application is an open-source software that provides researchers a tool to assess the performance of a building to wind loading. The application is focused on quantifying the uncertainties in the predicted response, given that the properties of the building and the wind loads are not known exactly, and given that the simulation software and the user make simplifying assumptions in the numerical modeling of the structure.
