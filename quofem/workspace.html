    <h2>QUOFEM</h2>
    <p>
        The Quantified Uncertainty with Optimization for the Finite Element Method (quoFEM) application (formerly uqFEM)
        is intended to advance the use of uncertainty quantification and optimization within the field natural hazards
        engineering. The application achieves this by combining existing finite element applications, e.g. FEAPpv, with
        uncertainty quantification (UQ) applications, e.g. Dakota, behind a simple user interface (UI).The combined
        application will enhance the finite element applications with uncertainty quantification and optimization
        capabilities.
        <br><br>

    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Local Desktop:</b> quoFEM can be downloaded to your local computer. The application can run using the
        cores on your desktop for small computations and the application will interface with DesignSafe Resources
        through the underlying API for large jobs.
